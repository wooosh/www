As an author of a personal website, I want to be able to easily integrate other authoring tools (LaTeX, GraphViz, plotting tools, etc) with little friction.<p>Using other tools from "canonical" markdown is somewhat of a pain, generally forcing you to move embedded content out to other files, and then compile your collection of documents and link everything together manually.<p>Some platforms have added inline support for other tools in their own flavor of markdown, notably <a href=https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/>Github adding support for Mermaid</a>.<p>While extensibility is also important to me, I personally find composability to be a much larger issue.<h2 id=heading6><a href=#heading6>'N+1 Standards', Other tools</a></h2><p>One thing that I think is especially important to address here, is that using your own format for authoring does not suffer the same issues associated with other types of new standards.<figure><img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png alt="xkcd 927: Standards"><figcaption>xkcd 927: Standards</figcaption></figure><p>The reasoning for this is that individual authoring tools are not <em>competing</em>. I don't expect (or even want) the format I use for this site to become adopted by anyone else. This enables me to move quickly, and tailor it to my specific needs on a whim.<p>Moving the bottom line above a plaintext format for the sources of a blog does not impact anyone but the author, because it's not a protocol (especially given that every site has their own flavor). The final output is what really matters, because that's what people are going to see. There is nothing stopping you from providing a rendered markdown version of a document, while retaining the ergonomic benefits of your own format.<p>I'm aware of tools such as R-Markdown, which seem relatively streamlined, but they generally seem much more complex to modify than a solution I put together myself. Retaining the ability to change a format to suit my tastes is very important, instead of being continually frustrated with a format I have little power over.<h2 id=heading7><a href=#heading7>Moving Forward</a></h2><p>I see two main ways to move forward from markdown, syntax wise:<ol><li>Use a primarily text format, with an escape sequence of some kind to embed source code of other tools.<li>Use a structured format, and explicitly denote text sections.</ol><p>While I use #2 for ease of implementation, I believe it has some other merits:<ul><li>Semantic information about document structure is explicit<li>I find that indenting each section as a block makes it a lot easier to edit and read compared to a flat markdown document<li>You automatically gain some editor support, which makes reorganization super easy</ul><p>However, I think that #1 is equally (if not more) viable, and a text-first approach is probably more inline with the philosophy of markdown, and less verbose to write in, while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing articles written in markdown.<p>In addition to adding special blocks to integrate with other authoring tools, there are several other areas of potential improvement I can think of:<ul><li>Inline math notation<li>Support for smallcaps, underlines<li>Using semantic highlighting/coloring to refer to identifiers from a code block<li>Custom elements (diff views, inline REPLs, etc)<li>Inline compile-time scripting</ul><h2 id=heading8><a href=#heading8>Conclusion</a></h2><p>It seems clear at this point that markdown is a good enough solution for most people, but I'd encourage trying out your own format when you start to push at the boundaries.<p>If you already use your own format, or decide to create your own, please share it in the comments below!</p><noscript><div class=note>Unfortunately, inline comments are provided using utteranc.es, which requires JavaScript to function.<br>You can either view and leave comments on <a href=https://github.com/wooosh/blog/issues>GitHub</a>, or enable client-side JavaScript for this website.</div></noscript><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=wooosh/blog issue-term=title theme=preferred-color-scheme crossorigin=anonymous async></script><footer>wooo.sh is powered by Tcl<br>[<a href=https://github.com/wooosh/blog>Site Generator Source</a>]</footer></main>
